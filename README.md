# Really-Cool-Note-Taker

## Description

In this project, I was required to create an app that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This required the usage of Express.js, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the assignment, but I did learn a lot about routing and how to set up middleware through my researching on the internet!

## Troubles

* I tried to route the correct file paths in my server.js, api.js, and htmls.js files, but failed to do so. I kept getting routed to the error page saying "Cannot get /notes".

* I couldn't get the notes.html page to properly save and delete, but it does work when you enter in text into the text boxes.

* I had troubles with linking the CSS file on the notes.html page, but eventually got that out of the way.
